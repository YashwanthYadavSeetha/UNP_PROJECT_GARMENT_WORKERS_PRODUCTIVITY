Garment-Worker-Productivity-using-Machine-Learning.

Completed this project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP).

Key highlights:
Studied and Analyzed the Garment worker productivity dataset to applying ML models and present my insights.
Performed various Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and compare the variables.
Experimented with different Machine Learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Neural Networks, Bagging, and Boosting and compared the results to recommend the best Regression model.
